To the list of great Matlab alternative I add today
[RSTUDIO](http://www.rstudio.org/).
Although, I usually don't program in R, I am glad to see it is not
freezing, and continuously develop as a scientific interested language.
I am guessing that this fancy IDE for R, would make it easier to accept
among people who are deeply rooted in the EXCELLENT MATLAB IDE.
However, doing most of my scientific tasks, and system administration in
python, I think Matlab's syntax is equally weird to that of R ;-).

One weird choice of the developers is to call the binary `rdesktop`
instead of `rstudio`... Maybe they don't know about
[rdesktop](http://packages.debian.org/search?searchon=names&suite=all&section=all&keywords=rdesktop)\
which is familiar to most system administrators ... oh, well, I guess
I'll have to open a bug ...
