Sometimes I can just wonder.An [idiot](http://blogs.forrester.com/mike_gualtieri) 
posts a blog which shows the guy has no clue what he's talking about. And people actually
make such a fuss about it.  
The guy writes [here](http://blogs.forrester.com/mike_gualtieri/11-10-25-mobile_proliferation_killed_linux_hopes_for_world_domination?cm_mmc=RSS-_-IT-_-942-_-blog_1858)
Sure, Android is built on top of Linux, but [Linux is only one of many piece parts of the Android mobile operating
system](http://developer.android.com/guide/basics/what-is-android.html).
It is not Linux. 
Anyone who knows what a [Linux distribution](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_distribution) 
is, would agree that no linux distribution is Linux according to this definition.
So, Mr. Analyst my S. Next time I meet people with your title, I will seriously think how I should tag them.
I would not even bother suggesting this guy takes a "Non-Linux" like Debian or Ubuntu for a try.
Idiots like this guy deserve to punished for the rest of their lives sitting in
front of a computer with Windows 7.
