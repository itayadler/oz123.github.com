  <title>How not to use the kill Command on Linux</title>

  <content type="xhtml">
    <div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A few months ago I installed Debian GNU/Linux on an old Sony Vaio Laptop of a friend of mine. The laptop is really nice with slim case and a 15" screen. She was really happy she could write her thesis on this nice machine again because Windows XP could not function properly on this machine. Installation was a breeze and  the non technical friend of mine was working on it happily for 4 months now.

With time I've noticed that there are some repeating patterns to what I skip, so I've compiled this list to those who want to save some time, and a reminder to myself.
