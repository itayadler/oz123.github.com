I have been waiting quite a while to write this post. I think it's about
time that people who want to write FOSS and support FOSS will also buy
hardware from manufacturers that support it. One good way is to buy
directly hardware which is designed like that.

So here is a list of stuff I can really recommend or I'd like to buy:

1. Portable Music Player with rockbox:

[SansaClip+](http://www.sandisk.com/products/sansa-music-and-video-players/sandisk-sansa-clipplus-mp3-player),
by itself this little player is not open source or open hardware.
However, it is cheap and reliable and runs
[rockbox](http://www.rockbox.org/). And that is really the best thing
about this player. The original firmware comes with pretty limited and
dumb interface, it does not support playing OGG or FLAC files, for
example. Installing rockbox on this player enables that, further more,
rockbox has many cool plugins. A favorite of mine is the simple
Stopwatch which allows me to measure times when I jog. \
I wish someone in Sandisk would realize how redundant it is to make
their own firmware, and they would just adopt rockbox officially. After
all, another cool thing about this player is its expansion slot for
reading Mini-SD cards.\
Rockbox has made me more satisfied with this player, and left me
astonished when I saw the [user
manual](http://download.rockbox.org/daily/manual/rockbox-sansaclipplus.pdf),
it is maybe the user manual I've seen for an open source project (except
maybe the [FreeBSD
handbook](http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/)).

2. Router+File Server\
\
I think I am not very wrong, if I say that most people I know has a home
wireless network. Good chances that this W-LAN router is running some
kind of Linux based OS with a web interface. The advanced users can try
and replace this OS with a user friendlier and more capable OS like
OpenWRT or DD-WRT. \
But what is better than buying a device which is already pre-installed
with one? Here is a Linux Friendly router, the Buffalo WZR-HP-G300NH,
this is the[Wiki page dedicated to this little
router](http://www.dd-wrt.com/wiki/index.php/Buffalo_WZR-HP-G300NH), and
there is a very [good blog documenting that
router](http://g300nh.blogspot.com/) what you can do with it.\
Right now, my Buffalo is running a File server, and of course the W-Lan
and I am very happy with this  40 USD embedded computer. I'm so happy
with it, that I might get another one, and install full blown Debian on
it.

3. Tablets

It's been a while that I am thinking of buying my own tablet or an
e-book reader. However, I'm late to join the crowds and I don't want to
pay money for computer that I need to break into to get a root password.
There for this rules out 99% of the Android tablets and others.\
I just ordered 2 [spark devices](http://makeplaylive.com/). These little
machines are pure Linux (not [Linux with
Handcuffs.](http://www.android.com/))\
But there are other devices which have Linux on them, such the
[Smartbook](http://alwaysinnovating.com/touchbook/) or
[WeTab](http://wetab.mobi/en).

4. Laptops

Well, there are  many by now. And it's good, I've compiled a small list
of [laptops sold with Linux](http://linuxpixies.blogspot.com/p/linux-laptops.html).

If you have suggestions to this list please let me know!
