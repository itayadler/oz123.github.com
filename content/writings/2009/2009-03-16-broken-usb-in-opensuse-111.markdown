Last week I upgraded one of my workstations at work to version 11.1 from 11.0 only to discover this week that automounting of usb disks has ceased to work.
Someone in Novell managed to break this somehow. I remeber how a similar bug which was not adressed by canonical drove me away from Ubuntu to Debian.
I always warn people against this terrible bloated distro called OpenSUSE. Here is another evidence...
This is probably a solvable bug, but the fact that there has not been a centralized patch indicated where this company put it's users.
To be honest I keep working with OpenSUSE only in the frame of 'get to know the enemy'.

Be warned, if you install opensuse you are expected to have similar problems. Instead you should probably opt for Debian.
