After a very long time I did not use Windows for my private needs, I
have finally found the times to take a longer look on Windows 7. I have
decided to install the operating system on a real machine to see it's
real behaviour and interaction with plastic and iron.\
Here are a few quick observations. The installer is WAY better than
Windows XP. I have no clue how it was in Widows Vista. Unfortunately
Windows still requires a lot of reboots until the process is done. It
took about 1hour to complete the installation, and after that I feared I
will have to click hundreds of next next next to finish the process of
configuring the hardware and installing software to make the Laptop
usable. Fortunately, I kept the disk of drivers which came with the
laptop when I bought it. The auto installer just did the job with out to
much pain. My next step was to google and find if there is already a
DECENT [Package manager for windows](http://code.google.com/p/windows-package-manager/). 
Guess what ? there are a few of them. And after testing a little bit I settled on
NPacked. It is not perfect, but it made the computer somewhat more reach
with software with relatively little pain. 
[My biggest criticism on it](http://code.google.com/p/windows-package-manager/issues/detail?id=106&colspec=ID%20Type%20Status%20Stars%20Milestone%20Summary%20Opened),
is the sparse collection of software available, and the fact that it
does not read local XML file, only those hosted on some webserver. I
hope posting here will publish NPacked somewhat more and help it gain
more software to the repo. Unfortunately, this project seems like a one
man show, which does not really ensure the sustainability of this
project.

There is not much more to say. I am not so eager to use that OS, but I
have to make myself some what familiar with it.
