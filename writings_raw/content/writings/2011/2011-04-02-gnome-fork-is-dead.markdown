The [EXDE project](http://www.exde.org), which aimed to continue
supporting gnome 2.X is dead. This is really a shame, 
I wish I could have taken part in it. I really like the user experience
that GNOME 2.X offered new comers to Linux, and it was always my default
recommendation when I installed a new laptop with Linux to a friend. 

I will keep looking for an alternative for GNOME 2.X, and I already
expect to start working with XFCE 4.8 on my installed Debian.
