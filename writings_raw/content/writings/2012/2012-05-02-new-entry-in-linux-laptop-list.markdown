I am looking for a new laptop. 14" is a bit hard to fit in the bag
sometimes.
While I searched  for a new 12" laptop, I found [garlac.eu](http://www.garlach44.eu/). 
Their 14" laptop is exactly the Clevo I have, the 13.3" version I bought to my girlfriend under the
brand name Belina in Germany. It's a good laptop. But the one in Garlac
comes either with equiped with old AMD version or newer with Intel but
equipped with NVIDIA.

Sorry, I DON'T buy AMD. Until someone here or in AMD convinces me that
they do a better job with Linux. The second option, NVIDIA is an  utter
crap. NVIDIA drivers is the biggest piece of s\$\#% I ever saw, and in
my work place, I curse a lot when I need to mess with NVIDIA card on a
CAE workstation or some cluster.

But... if you are looking for a good 14.1" laptop and you are in
Europe... The [Rush 14.1](http://www.garlach44.eu/en/rush-14-1-en-n)
seems like a good choice.
