I have a weired hobby, checking very frequently the[Release-Critical Bugs](http://bugs.debian.org/release-critical/) in Debian.
It's kind of a magic window to all this wonderful packages found in
Debian. Sometimes I'm horrified to see so many bugs opened at once. Like
now ... 169 FTBS introduced by GCC-4.7...

It's no reason to panic, but it's been a while since I've seen such a
huge bump up ...
