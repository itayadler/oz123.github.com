I am announcing here the release of the ebuilds collection of mate-desktop
for gentoo. All ebuilds support building with traditional GTK+2 and the 
newer GTK+3.

You should be able to use those ebuild with layman adding my overlay found
at the [following repository oz123/mate-de-gentoo](https://github.com/oz123/mate-de-gentoo).

In the mean while some packages have been already updated to 1.14.1 by
mate developers. These will come soon into the overlay.
