Since I posted in my blog about GNOME 2 fork, I have seen numerous hits.
In 4 months since than, this single post had more than 3 times hit compared to my second most
popular post about [TMUX copy mode.](http://linuxpixies.blogspot.com/2011/06/tmux-copy-mode-and-how-to-control.html)
Yesterday, I bumped into a young [fork of GNOME 2](http://matsusoft.com.ar/redmine/projects/mate), called MATE. 
Named after the Argentinian herb infusion. Let's hope this project will not
have a bitter end like the drink, and rather long sweet life. The odd
choices of developers are sometimes annoying. While it might seems
narrow minded of me, I do expect a project that aims to be the size of
GNOME2, to write a document or two in English. He, but what do I know
there are actually more Spanish speaking people. I should learn Spanish
instead of blogging...
I will try Mate sometimes probably.But in the mean while, thanks to
GNOME developers I have been looking into alternatives and found my own
peace within DWM, and now I am building my Desktop from Scratch.
