Microsoft will block non Windows on the ARM platform. Big deal. It is if
installing Linux on any other Laptop is easy. Sure you can install Linux
on most Laptops today. But does it really work? Do you get the same
battery time with Linux as with Windows? Nope. Do your multimedia Keys
work? In 90% of the cases only partially. Does your computer suspend or
hibernates as in Windows? in about 50% of the cases the answer is no.
Does your Graphics Card works the same as under Windows ? NOPE.

So, the situation is like this: OEM A makes a deal with M\$ and writes
proper drivers to the hardware and SomeUser Joe gets a hardware which
works perfect with Windows 7. Later, SomeUser Joe, installs SomeCrack
for SomeCoolSoftware which contains a Trojan which he can't get rid of.
After some frustration, he decides to quit with this M\$ thingi and give
Ubuntu a try, because he heard it's cool. He than tries Ubuntu and
discovers some things don't work. Here our little story splits.

First possibility, the Linux Sucks possibility. SomeUser Joe, is
frustrated, his computer will freeze every time he resumes it from
suspend. Or the graphics card is slow, or the Fan always works loudly.
Linux Sucks. Period. SomeUser Joe, bites it, and installs Windows 7. His
next computer will be Apple.

Second possibility, the Linux has a cool community, SomeUser Joe, heard
about it and wants to join. So, he files another bug, which might be
taken seriously, or not, in Ubuntu's bugzilla. This bug might find it's
way upstream to the Kernel developers and they might solve it, but the
patch will only be in the next release of Ubuntu maybe in 6 months from
now. Damn speculations. But Linux works at most. So, in 3 years from now
SomeUser Joe, might look for a new Laptop, without the Windows Tax, and
will save a scrap of 50 bucks, which he will spend 100 times more money
in working hours value digging through forums and IRC channels trying to
get he's M\$ free Laptop to work.

Third Possibility, SomeUser Joe buy his next Laptop with Linux
pre-installed. Hell yes! UEFI is a great thing. I wish all M\$ devices
would never run Linux. It will force Linux fan boys to see that by
saving \$50 to \$100 dollars buying a Laptop from OEM's which sell
Windows, they sleep with the Devil. UEFI is a great opportunity to Linux
and FOSS, because we have a great OS in our hands and now we have also
Free Hardware like the BeagleBoard, PandaBoard, RaspberryPi and even the
GTA04.

There are some small companies the sell Linux laptops which have the
latest trends in hardware. If there are just 1 Million Linux users and
just one third of them will buy a new device this year, that is about
300,000 laptops sold with Linux. I think this is a huge jump in sales
for a small company like ZaReason or System76. They would be then more
then able to go out on a broad campaign putting Linux on the main stream
student Laptop. 

So, please, stop whining about UEFI. Just don't buy laptop from OEM like
Dell or Lenovo or Acer or Asus. There are ENOUGH alternatives for
Preinstalled Linux Laptops. Here is a short list:\


-   [System76](http://system76/)
-   [Zareason](http://zareason.com/)
-   [Rockiger](http://rockiger.com/de/shop/product/satchbook)
-   [ohava](http://www.ohava.com/) 
-   [AlwaysInnonvating](http://www.alwaysinnovating.com/)

If you happen to know of others, please let me know !

(P.S. Dell don't count! Dell's Ubuntu offering mock Linux users,
offering a free OS with lousy hardware which costs more than the Windows
installed laptops with cost cheaper for better hardware. Just because of
this mockery, I will never recommend any customer of mine or buy myself
any product of Dell).
