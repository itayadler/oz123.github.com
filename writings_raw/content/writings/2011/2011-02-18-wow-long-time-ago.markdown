Wow, Long time ago ... My last post ages ago was a rant about Uhbuntu.
Needless to say that since then, I have quit using Uhbunutu as my main
Desktop, and moved to Debian and ArchLinux. I also play extensively with
OpenBSD and FreeBSD, and at work my workstation is OpenSUSE from which I
maintain mostly CentOS servers. But no Uhbuntu ...
