For about 4 years now there is a possibility to get a Netbook with
Linux. Now, there are many of them coming with Android and Meego. Asus
has been shipping Linux for quite some times. Unfortunately, always as a
second citizen in it's laptops. The better models always come with
Windows. IMHO, it's stupid, because WIN7 just kills the system - i.e.
WIN7 Boots slower than WINXP although the hardware today is MUCH faster.
But back to what I wanted to write about. Today this really caught my
eyes browsing some laptops:

A Windows agnostic "WIN" button. I've seen that already in laptops which
come with Ubuntu pre-installed, but first time I see it with a main line
manufacturer! Such a shame that the same model which comes in white does
have the Win button. The laptop by the way is ASUS Eee PC X101-BLK022G
which comes pre-installed with Intel's Meego Linux distribution.
