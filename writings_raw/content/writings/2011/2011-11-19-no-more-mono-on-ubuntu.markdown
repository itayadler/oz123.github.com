Well, it's a quite a late response, but it ought to be. After Ubuntu has
shoved Mono down our throats for quite a while, they have decided to
retreat from it. [As of Ubuntu 12.04 there will be no more Mono on the default install CD.](http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2011/11/banshee-tomboy-and-mono-dropped-from-ubuntu-12-04-cd/)

I want to curse Ubuntu Dev's for their actions so far, but their decision
to drop Mono, for what ever reason, is a considered a blessing by me. I
might even give it a spin again in 12.04 after about 2 years of not
touching Ubuntu.
