For a while now I have been neglecting this blog. In between working on a few
small open source projects, trying to master JAVA and JavaScript, Gentoo,
family, friends, and staying physically fit, I did not find much time to write.

But the blog has not been completely neglected. I've been working on a new old
design on a very slow pace. The new design is now responsive, so this blog can
be read on all devices. I've added modern JavaScript and CSS using twitter
bootstrap. Now reading this blog is much more fun.

Not only reading is more fun. I have changed how the blog is rendered to a new
static site generator (more on that on the next post...), so now writing and
publishing new posts is easier quicker, so I expect that the pace of posting
will increase.
