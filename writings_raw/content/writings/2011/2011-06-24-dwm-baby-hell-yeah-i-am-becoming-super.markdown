F\#!k yeah! I am using a [tiling window manager](http://dwm.suckless.org/) called DWM, and it is the best thing
I have seen lately. Easy to compile, easy to use, and there is no mouse
involved, my hands are not painful anymore after a work day (well, they
do, if I go climbing...). 

That said, I am also using
[Pentadactyl](http://dactyl.sourceforge.net/pentadactyl/index) which negated the mouse usage also in side Firefox. 
My hands will thank me for that in 40 years. No more painful joints....
