Ubuntu "engineers" are probably dumber than Enterprise Linux OS's engineers. 
I got a laptop from a friend who asked me to install the latest Ubuntu on
it. My usual technique of make a live bootable usb faild.
So, I googled and found this [evidence that Ubuntu engineers are
retarded.](http://www.ubuntu.com/download/help/create-a-usb-stick-on-ubuntu)

You need Ubuntu to install Ubuntu. This reminds me a bit that Redmond company. 
What if I have another OS ? NOT Mac or Windows ? For example, Debian? can't you just write how to
obtain that package ???
