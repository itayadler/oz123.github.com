Take a loot at this [post](http://ubuntuguide.net/how-to-run-multiple-copies-of-program-from-unity-launcher).
You need a "how to" to run multiple copies of the same program. Hmm...
Ubuntu is turning Linux boxes into IPHONES who are locked down to run
one application at the time. 
Idiots. We have multicore processors, and more multithreaded
applications, but Ubuntu users need a how to if they want to open two
instances of GEDIT for example if they want to compare two documents,
and NOT use TABS. 
Honesty, the title of my previous post was "[Are Linux developers getting dumber](http://linuxpixies.blogspot.com/2011/05/better-apps-in-linux.html)"
maybe I should not have censor myself.
