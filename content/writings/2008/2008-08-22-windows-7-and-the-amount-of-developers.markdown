summary: The marker Israel publishes a [translated article](http://it.themarker.com/tmit/article/4273) from IDG were they mention that Microsoft has about 2000 people working on the next generation of Windows, 500  people are in charge of the 2000 developers. And my guess is that Microsoft will have triple the amount of people selling (or trying to sell that operating system).

Debian has about 1000 developers, but much much more contributors, who test, integrated and propose improvements. And that's just the number of people who actually work on the Debian project itself. Debian comes with about 18,000 software packages, which are developed by people outside of Debian project. The number of Kernel developers is about the same today [(~1000)](http://www.linuxdevices.com/news/NS6925891609.html), and let's be humble about the number of people developing all the other programs used in Debian and say that only one person is writing each program. That brings us to about at least 15,000 people who contribute code, time ideas and effort to Debian.

No wonder [Debian](http://www.debian.org) is so great. Eventually open source will win, you guys in Redmond have to understand: there is no future for propriety software...
