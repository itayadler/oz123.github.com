A couple of nights ago I was browsing code.google.com in random search
for interesting Python projects.\
Here are two nice catches from my random fishing, which are worth
mentioning. The first one is a [Free python

and the joy of creating software for kiddies, here is what they write as
an intro:\
\
"Snake Wrangling for Kids" is a printable electronic book, for children
8 years and older, who would like to learn computer programming. It
covers the very basics of programming, and uses the Python 3 programming
language to teach the concepts. \

The second one, is a [Python interactive
learning](http://code.google.com/p/rur-ple/) program. Although I have
not played a lot with it, it seems fun. However, the project seems a
little bit sleepy (no updates for almost a year):\
\
 RUR-PLE is an environment designed to help you learn computer
programming using the language Python. Within an artificial world in
which a robot can be programmed to perform various tasks, you will learn
what it means to write a computer program, using Python's syntax \
\
If you are a self learner type like me, you would appreciate these
resources. \
