Last week I participated in a Windows 7 course. I was sent to the course
by my employer, although in my official role is Linux System Engineer. 9
people attended the course. Looking around my colleagues I had some
interesting observations, I'd like to share.\
First of all, among the participants, I was the youngest. 2 Other guys
where also Linux admins, the rest were Windows admins. Some external
appearances really struck me. Usually, Linux guys have the image of
being wild hairy beasts with long unshaven beards. Well ... there are
some differences with the Windows guys, but not what I expected:\

-   All the Linux guys were younger then 35, windows guys are older.
    This is a very strong indicator about the[future of this
    OS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Structure_of_Scientific_Revolutions).
-   The Linux Guys (including me) dress sportive casual stuff, short
    pants, some sport brand cool shirt or just plain T's. Windows guys
    are dressed business casual: jeans or some fancy pants, with a
    button up shirt tucked in their pants behind some leather belt
    usually holding a role over fat stomach.
-   Linux Guys come to the course cycling (MTB or Road bike), Windows
    guys all came with a Car, which can explain the fat stomach
    phenomena.
-   Out of 6 guys, 3 guy actually had facial hairs, and our instructor a
    mustache! Personally, I find [people with
    mustaches](http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2011/03/30/stiff_upper_lip)
    unreliable.

This are just my few observations on being in a Windows 7 course.

Another anecdote I have noticed while learning Windows 7, is it's lousy
backward compatibility. Windows 7 does not include Solitaire or
Minesweeper, at least in the VM's we had ... Imagine, passing 2 days in
front of the most boring OS, without minesweeper...
