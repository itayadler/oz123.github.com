This should be really bigger news! Although I don't use KDE at all, Kile
is the best editor for Latex, I have tried. The developers released 5
beta versions before, which never gave me any problem.
11 Days ago, kile 2.1 was finally released, here is the [release announcement](http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/message.php?msg_id=27632215).

I love how simple Kile is, although it is full with goodies and options.
I love how it is out of the way when you want it. I tried contributing
to [Gummi-latex editor](http://gummi.midnightcoding.org/). But
eventually, I found it useless. 

I love the VIM mode in Kile, and I wish it was possible in some GTK+
Editor. Yeah, I know I can use vim-latex-suite. But I am too lazy to
learn it :-). So, I use vim for all other programming, and Kile for
Latex.

So, bottom line, I really recommend to download and install latest Kile!
