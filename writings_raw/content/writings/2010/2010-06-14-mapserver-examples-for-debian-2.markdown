I've made a package of the Itasca example that are supposed to work  "out of the box" for Debian Lenny and Squeeze.
I intended to push it in the repositories, but due to lack of time, I  gave up on the idea. So instead I put the tar file here. You can  download it.
And unpack it your /var/www directory.
Accessing localhost/mapserver you'll find the itasca examples working  (at least, I hope so...).

Of course you need to install before hand the packages of apache2 and  cgi-mapserver.

So, with out further a due - here's the tar file:
[ad#banner]

[mapserver_examples.tar.gz](http://www.tabula0rasa.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/mapserver_examples.tar.gz).

Download, and untar in /var/www.

Access localhost/mapserver from your browser. Now you can start  exploring MapServer.
