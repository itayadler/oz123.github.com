summary: The match between Germany to Argentina brings a nice conclusion. The team work has proven superior to the "All Star" teams based on players such as Messi or Ronaldo. Both of them didn't score in this world cup.

Plus, I think Mexico played much better against Argentina, and Tevez only got an offside goal which completely demoralized the Mexicans , who later lost the game.

It was nice watching Joachim Low wearing a simple blue pull-over, comparing to Maradona's ridiculous out fits (with the two diamond earings, and the two watches). It it wonderful that super-stars lost, and the German Boys, who simply play together win. That's football the way football should be played.

Danke Deutschland, it was a thrilling game.
