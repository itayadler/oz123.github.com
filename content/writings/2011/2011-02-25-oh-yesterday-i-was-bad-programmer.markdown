Forgetting my first lesson in programming, I looked for a solution to
convert IP addresses to country. I found out tables, and SQL files, and
went on and on trying to figure how to use them, and do SQL in
python. 
Until, I remembered that a good programmer should not re-invent what has
been invented. 
And then I looked around and found:
[pygeoip](http://code.google.com/p/pygeoip/).
I honestly felt sorry for the time I wasted on that problem ...
