    The idea I need to learn X Programming Language (e.g. JavaScript) in order to customize my desktop is IMHO simply IDIOTIC! Although I love learning programming languages, and I am a programmer, I DON'T WANT to program my desktop. My desktop is not a problem I need to solve. It should just work.

    I've attended Vancouver Critical Mass. Yay! It was fun, about 2000 cyclist came to have fun. We even had a police escort. About 15 police men...Well, the city of Vancouver is probably the most dumb city I've seen in regards to bikes. They try to encourage bicycles, eh ? So, on the way back home, guess what, a couple of nice traffic police men where waiting on 10th Ave, where many people cycle home, and they just gave all the cyclists fines of 29 CAD.

    Recently I started learning Fortran. Going from Python to Fortran should not be so complicated, and from what I see so far it is a very cool language.
