The idea I need to learn X Programming Language (e.g. JavaScript) in
order to customize my desktop is IMHO simply IDIOTIC! Although I love
learning programming languages, and I am a programmer, I DON'T WANT to
program my desktop. My desktop is not a problem I need to solve. It
should just work.


Have you ever seen a customized Gnome Shell? You can do quite a lot, and
practically anything if you know javascript.

If I wanted to program my Desktop, I'd probably learn Lua and use
something crazy like AWESOME WM (But in the mean while I'm fine with DWM
and GNOME 2.30).

BTW, Shlomi, \
I consider my self a power user. \
Never the less the only plugin I still use and always install in
Firefox, is FireFTP. That is simply because it's the most convenient FTP
solution I found in Linux which does not require me to use the FTP
command line. This is actually a who application IMHO and not a plugin.
\
I do use Pentadactyl to change FF UI, and \
that is also something I find an Application by itself. But if I have to
install "Pentadactyl" for GNOME 3, why note just go for the real thing
and install DWM, RatPoison or any other Tiling WM ?

I don't think firefox became popular because of it's extension. I liked
it because it was simply better than Explorer when I switched to it (the
killer feature was Tabs). Then when I switched to Linux there was no
Explorer. \
\
Be honest, how many NON technical user install plug-ins ??? I have
seldom seen people in my work (I support Engineers on CAE Linux work
stations) install plugins. \
\
I don't think \>\>I\<\< want to write one to get my Desktop running. \
\
The Idea might be great like the ideas behind KDE4. But the
implementation was LOUSY and shows the GNOME dev's didn't learn
anything.

I've seen some of Shell's extensions and so far it seem that these
extensions can do almost anything you want.\
As published last week, a new site for Gnome Shell extensions was opened
and it already contains some very useful extensions. So, IMO, give it
some time.\
\
I think this has great potential of becoming "The "Firefox of Desktops".
And don't forget - when Firefox was just released, it also has only a
few extensions.
