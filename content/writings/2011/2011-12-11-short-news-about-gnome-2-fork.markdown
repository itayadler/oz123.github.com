Well, I've been following the [Development of Mate DE](https://github.com/Perberos/Mate-Desktop-Environment)
quite closely via github and it seems like the project is gaining momentum.
It gained the support of Linux Mint Dev's and now it has it's own website, so I'd
like to give here the link to the GNOME 2 Desktop alternative, in hope
more peope will contribute and join. I will contribute and join. 
Since there is now a [Debian repository for MATE DE](http://mate.karapetsas.com/), 
I intend to test it hands on, and not just observe from the side.
