I took a break from blogging because I moved to a new location. In addition, 
I got tired of fighting blogger.com interface and the impossibilities it 
cohered on me. 
Therefore, I was playing around with a few static blogging engines, and to be
honest, I found most of them either to complicated for my needs, or too simple. 
The one I liked the most, was a simple script called make.py, written by 
[Mir Nazim](http://mirnazim.org/). 
I took it and started building my blog using it. In addition I documented some 
of the quirks this system has and fixed a few bugs, and added some little features.
Hence, I took the liberty to rename [make.py](https://github.com/mnazim/mnazim.github.com/blob/master/make.py) 
to [blogit](https://github.com/oz123/blogit), and repost it in github.com where my blog resides for now.

Since my main goal is writing and documenting my learning process, I avoid fancy 
stuff in this blog, hence the simple template, and not much around it. If time 
permits, I will create a few more templates, maybe as an exercise in Web programming, 
although this is really not my core interest.

In the mean while feel free to reuse blogit for your own needs.
