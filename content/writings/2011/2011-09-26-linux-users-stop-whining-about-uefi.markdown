Operating System should really stop whining about the UEFI secure
booting.
I see no difference between someone who buys a laptop made by Apple and
a someone who buys a Laptop with Windows OS. As the saying goes: "If you
sleep with dogs, you wake up with flees". For a very long time the Linux
Community ignored the WINTEL monopoly and did very little to support
free hardware manufacturers. Many people would invest tons of time in
hacking and patching Linux and drivers where they where manufacturers
ignored deliberately or unintentionally Linux.
I don't buy hardware very often. And so most people who use Linux don't
need to. But when I do buy hardware or asked to recommend hardware, I
never do buy anything with Windows, or NVIDIA, or ATI.
I won't even answer friends or family question in the style "can you
recommend this WinLaptop or that WinLaptop?". Sounds extreme, I know.
But in fact, my strategy works. I have successfully bought my own Laptop
from a small company that sells Clevo laptops with out windows. And more
than 5 friends of mine who saw "Linux Just Works" out of the box,
decided to buy these laptops too. I think it shows that there is a
Market for people who are not interested in Windows. Even if it is
small, it is growing.
But besides looking for a Laptop which does not come with Windows. You
can specifically buy Hardware from manufacturers that do support Linux.
Nowadays the ARM architecture is rising, and provides computational 
power which is enough for most home users. 
In fact, the[beagleboard](http://beagleboard.org/) provided more computational
power than my 6 years old Laptop which still works. Not only that, the
architecture is completely open, so I know, no UEFI Secure boot will
shit on my head from the manufacturer. 
There are a few more hardware manufacturers which make nice and OPEN
hardware. To mention a few:
[gumstix](http://www.gumstix.com/),
[opencircuits](http://www.opencircuits.com/Main_Page),
[hawkboard](http://www.hawkboard.org/),
[pandaboard](http://pandaboard.org/),
[igep](http://www.igep.es/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=46&Itemid=55)
and[even
more.](http://processors.wiki.ti.com/index.php?title=OMAP3_Boards.%20)
And there is even a whole [Laptop/Tablet based on beagle board.](http://www.alwaysinnovating.com/home/index.htm)
You might mock the "lousy" or humble hardware offering in this free
field. But in fact it is enough for text processing and multimedia. It
is enough for me, and I know, my next laptop, will be based on ARM,
because I give a #!$% about UEFI, and I don't care what Microsoft
does. Instead of fighting it directly, I will give my money to companies
which promote my computational freedom. 
I hope this post will encourage at least one extra person to re-consider
his next WINTEL/AMD/NVIDIA buying.

Shai,
I tend to doubt it. First of all, Linux could always find tricks like
Plop.
Second, there is still virtual machines for Windows. And finally, BeOS,
was commercial, and there was no ARM. 
Third, I could easily see the BRIC countries strongly start installing
Linux in Schools on Beagle board based computers. It will be the final
BLOW to Wintel. 
And finally, one Linux will stop trying to go mainstream through the
door, it will be discovered. No body asks for dual booting his Android
with WinCE, and yet Android devices are sold in millions.

Pixie, you're getting at it from the wrong direction. "Straight" Linux
users are not affected at all by this. It only gets in the way of
conversions. That is, the way it is designed now, Windows 8 will not
boot without "secure UEFI", and Linux won't boot with it. The results:

1) You will no longer be able to just hand out a LiveCD and say "try
it!". A Windows-8-Logo-certified PC won't boot a LiveCD without mocking
with the BIOS, and then won't boot Windows until you restore the BIOS
settings.

2) It will be a lot harder to dual-boot, which is a critical phase in
the path of most converts.

You should google "BeOS" -- the story of the commercial OS who was
better than Windows, but was killed through denying dual-boot.
