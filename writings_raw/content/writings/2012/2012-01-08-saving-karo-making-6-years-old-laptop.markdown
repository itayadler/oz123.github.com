Karo is the second laptop I got, I bought in my second year of Uni, in
2005. Karo, diamond in Turkish, is an HP Compaq nx6110 business Laptop.
I have used it through my Bachelor and my Master studies. During these 5
years, I upgraded its memory from 512MB to 2GB, and replaced the
Harddrive a few times from 40GB to 80GB and then to 120GB and finally to
160GB.

On the last year of its business warranty the laptop had problems with
the CD-ROM and one of the USB ports died as a result of bad wiring. So,
HP took the laptop and installed a whole new motherboard on their
expense.

About a year later, when I was between my Master and Bachelor, I was on
a very shaky bus ride and Karo fell off the luggage compartment 2m down.
Although it was in a special case, the screen splintered and was not
readable anymore.

Just going out of school, I was not able to replace the laptop  so
quickly, so for about 130 Euro, I bought a compatible LCD screen and
replaced it myself. To my surprise it worked very nicely. HP have a very
nice service manual which accompanied me since then.
So now Karo, had many new parts, and it was not worth buying a new
laptop. I started studying a Master, and karo served me well. Until 4
months before I graduated, while I was writing my thesis, karo became
extremely noisy.

It's fan was working non stop, and it was never able to cool itself down
once it went over 65C degrees. I didn't feel like experimenting so much,
and the only thing that bother me about Karo besides the noise was it's
damn heavy weight. So I bought yenikaro, a new light weight 14" laptop
which was nice and quiet with a weight of 1.4 Kg.
Karo, moved away from the table, and was seldom turned on. However, 
this weekend, I decided to revive karo, and see if I can fix the noise
problem. I followed HP excellent guide on how to access the fan. Once I
open the laptop, lo and behold, karo had between it's fan and the vent I
found a huge bulk of fibers and dust, it was so big, I just had to take
a photo of it:

I removed the fan, and than carefully cleaned all the insides of the
laptop from dust and fibers and other fine particles. Then, I closed it,
and rebooted into my Debian again. Karo, is silent again. Now it just
needs a new Harddrive replacement for the 3 years old hard drive and it
can be used again ...
